# binance-bot

## Configuration

Create a `config.json` file at the root of the project with:

```
{
  "APIKEY": "",
  "APISECRET": ""
}
```

## What it currently does

* List your account's balance

## TO-DO

I'm still deciding how I'll handle the UI. Simple console.log's? Blessed?

## Development

* `npm run build` for building the project;
* `npm run watch` for building and watching the project;
* `npm run exec` runs the transpiled code.
